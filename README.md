# Corey Alix

I'm currently building a personal web presence while looking for a great job to finish the 4th quarter of my career strong and satisfied.

My CV is [here](https://ca0v.github.io/ca0v/resume/index.html).

## Projects

These projects had a purpose beyond practicing with technology.  Some are behind a API key firewall but you can view source on all of them and they are all in a public github repo.
