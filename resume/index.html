        Dear Human Resources, <br /><br />
        I am responding to your job posting for a
        <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>. I strongly agree with your definition
        of a team player. As a Carnegie Mellon graduate, I have come to love the
        phrase, <q>my heart is in the work.</q> I am motivated, ambitious, and
        passionate about the work, and I am always looking for ways to improve
        myself and my team. If you know what is needed to generate value, then I
        will find a way to meet that need. I will produce significant results
        and contribute early and often. I am particularly motivated by
        result-driven bonuses and I am ready to produce value.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please find my <a class="ul" href="./cv.html">resume</a> attached. I
        look forward to hearing from you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sincerely, <br /><br />
        <b>Corey Alix</b>
