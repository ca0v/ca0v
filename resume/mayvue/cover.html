        Dear Mayvue Human Resources, <br /><br />
        I am responding to your job posting for a
        <b>Senior Software Engineer</b>. I strongly agree with Mayvue's
        definition of a team player. As a Carnegie Mellon graduate, I have come
        to love the phrase, <q>my heart is in the work.</q> I am motivated,
        ambitious, and passionate about the work, and I am always looking for
        ways to improve myself and my team. If Mayvue knows what is needed to
        generate value, then I can fulfill that need. I will produce significant
        results and contribute early and often. I am particularly motivated by
        the result-driven bonus policy and the fact that Mayvue is a small
        company with a big vision.
        <br />
        <br />
        I have worked with
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/claytongarcia/">Clayton Garcia</a>
        in the recent past, and he suggested this position as a great fit. With
        a strong desire to learn, deliver and generate value, I could not agree
        more.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please find my <a class="ul" href="./cv.html">resume</a> attached. I
        look forward to hearing from you.
        <br />
        <br />
        Sincerely, <br /><br />
        <b>Corey Alix</b>
